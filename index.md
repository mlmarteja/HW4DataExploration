### Marian Marteja

## Introduction

- While looking at the data, I focued on one region, which is NA. While exploring the data, I found that Nintendo dominated video game sales. To support this claim, I have looked at different visualizations that illustrates the sales of the Nintendo game sales and console sales.
- What will your supporting arguments be for your discovery?

## Dataset

- I am interested in the dataset because I have always been interested in videogames since I grew up playing it till this day. I chose the dataset because I wanted to see which Publishing company was timeless.(possibly change this or elaborate)

## Initial Questions

- Just like what I said under the data set section, I grew up around game and I wanted to see which is the most popular(change this)
- When looking the the data, these were the initial questions that I came up with: 

    * What regional sales from 2006-2013?
    * What were the sales of each game publisher?
    * Which top 5 consoles were most used from 2006-2013?
  
- What questions came up as you worked with the data? 
- Was there anything that surprised you about the data?
- While working with the data, I found that I didn't need to wangle the data. It was faily easy to work with it.
