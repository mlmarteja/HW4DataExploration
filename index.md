# Data Exploration -Video Game Sales
### Marian Marteja

## Introduction

- While looking at the data, I focued on one region, which is NA. While exploring the data, I found that Nintendo dominated video game sales. To support this claim, I have looked at different visualizations that illustrates the sales of the Nintendo game sales and console sales.
- What will your supporting arguments be for your discovery?

## Dataset
The dataset is available: [here](https://github.com/mlmarteja/HW4DataExploration/blob/5cb275d47977365659d0337783c9f13e146dd499/vgsales.csv)
The original dataset is from [Kagglel](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales)

Describe your data set, including a link to the data. 
- This dataset is video game sales data. The dataset contains Rank, Name, Platfrom, Year, Genre, Publisher, North American Sales, Japan Sales, Other Sales, and Global Sales. 
- This dataset is collected by Gregory Smith. This dataset is collected to compare game sales.(add more to this)
- I am interested in the dataset because I have always been interested in videogames since I grew up playing it till this day. I chose the dataset because I wanted to see which Publishing company was timeless.(possibly change this or elaborate)

## Initial Questions

- Just like what I said under the data set section, I grew up around game and I wanted to see which is the most popular(change this)
- When looking the the data, these were the initial questions that I came up with: 

    * What regional sales from 2006-2013?
    * What were the sales of each game publisher?
    * Which top 5 consoles were most used from 2006-2013?
  
- There were a two questions as I worked with the data. Firstly, I questioned whether I should focus on one region, and I did. Secondly, while working with the data, I found that Nintendo was dominating each graph. As a result, I questioned if that is true.
- One thing that surpised me was while examining the graphs, I found that Nintendo was top of the charts except for their consoles. I was surpised because since Nintendo make the most sales in terms of games, they did not sell the most consoles.
- While working with the data, I found that I didn't need to wangle the data. It was faily easy to work with it.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Nintendo has been dominating the market. Although I focued on 2006 to 2016, Nintendo has been dominating the gaming market since the 90's. Becuase of their influence back in the day, they still remain relevent today. Although one of the graphs has refuted by illustrating that XBox 360 has outsold Wii's, many of the graphs continue to support Nintendo outselling in every other market. Nintendo has always had a repuation of marketing great games. Nintendo has built a sense of excusivity in their games by marketing them as a Nintedo-only game. For example, games such as Wii sports, Zelda, and Super Mario can only be played on Nintendo devives and has always performed wornderfully. In addtion, Ninteod's marketing has benefited them greatly. They can market to competative and even to a casual audience. Furthermore, they release marketable devices. As of today, Nintendo's Switch continues to outsell many game consoles because of their marketing. The relsease of the Switch is good timing since this is the age where people are walking around and using portable devices such as a smartphone.
